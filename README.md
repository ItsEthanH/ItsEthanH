### Personally

-   🏃‍♂️ If I'm not coding, I'm probably exercising in some way. Currently, I'm training:
    -   🥊 Kickboxing (Purple Belt)
    -   🥋 Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (White Belt - still new!)
    -   💪 Calisthenics (PBs: BW Muscle Up/32.5kg Chinup/40kg Dip/110kg Squat)
-   🌍 If I'm not training, I'm travelling. My most recent excursion was to **🇪🇸 Barcelona, Spain**
-   🐕 If I'm not doing any of that, I'm a proud dog owner to Jet - my 9-year-old whippet
